# queue-stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wolfeidau/queue-stream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wolfeidau/queue-stream)

This module provides a simple stream interface to an AMQP message queue. The objective is to provide a small simple way
of consuming JSON based messages from a queue, with a way of dispatching events based on routing keys used in AMQP.

# TODO

* Add support for MQTT.
* Add the option to just pass an AMQP URL.
